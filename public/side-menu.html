			<h4>Gameplay Introduction</h4>
			<div id="sideIntro" class="intro-text" style="margin-top:8px;">
				<p>
					<strong>Quick Start</strong>— Your goal is to reveal all safe tiles
					without detonating any mines. Click tiles to reveal them, and
					right-click to flag tiles you believe contain a mine.
				</p>

				<h5>Rules & Controls</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Reveal</strong>: Left-click a tile to reveal what's
						underneath. If it's a mine you lose.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Flag</strong>: Right-click to mark a tile as a suspected
						mine; right-click again to remove the flag.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Numbers</strong>: Revealed numbers show the count of mines
						adjacent to that tile (including diagonals).
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Auto-reveal (chording)</strong>: If a revealed number has
						the same number of flags as its digit, clicking it will also reveal
						its unopened neighbors (this is called chording).
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>First click safety</strong>: In most variants, your first
						click is safe and opens at least one tile.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h5>Cheat Mode</h5>
				<p>
					Press <strong>C</strong> to enable cheat mode, which reveals all mines on the board by flagging them.
				</p>

				<h5>How to Read Numbers</h5>
				<p>
					The number on a revealed tile tells you how many mines are in the 8
					tiles around it. Use these numbers to logically deduce which nearby
					tiles are safe to open and which contain mines.
				</p>

				<h5>Basic Strategy</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Start at corners and open spaces — corners have fewer adjacent tiles
						so they're easier to deduce.
					</li>
					<li>
						Flag confidently — flags reduce uncertainty. If a 1 sits next to
						exactly one unopened square, that square is a mine.
					</li>
					<li>
						Avoid guessing when possible — deduce using multiple numbers or
						patterns.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h5>Common Patterns & Advanced Tips</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>1-2-1 pattern:</strong>A row like 1-2-1 often means the two
						outer tiles are mines, and middle is safe; use this to remove
						ambiguity.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Edge reasoning:</strong>On the board edge, numbers apply to
						fewer tiles so the math is simpler.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1.5-click:</strong>A common advanced technique is a fast
						chord — pressing both buttons (or double-click) to reveal
						surrounding tiles once you have flagged neighbors — use with care!
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h5>Teamplay Tips (for Multi-player)</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Use signals and chat to coordinate: say when you flag or suspect a
						tile, so others can avoid accidental clicks.
					</li>
					<li>
						When in doubt, share the reasoning: "This '3' is touching 3 unopened
						cells, two of which are already flagged — the third must be a mine."
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h5>Custom Mode Tips</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Keep width/height manageable — our board scales with your viewport
						so large boards can still fit but may be tiny on small screens.
					</li>
					<li>
						Keep "mines" &lt;= width*height - 1 or the game can't start; we
						enforce that in the UI and server side.
					</li>
					<li>
						When setting custom boards for tournaments, prefer known 'classic'
						dimensions for fairness.
					</li>
				</ul>
